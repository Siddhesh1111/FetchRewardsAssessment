# 2. Write a query that directly answers a predetermined question from a business stakeholder

Write a SQL query against your new structured relational data model that answers one of the following bullet points below of your choosing. Commit it to the git repository along with the rest of the exercise. Note: When creating your data model be mindful of the other requests being made by the business stakeholder. If you can capture more than one bullet point in your model while keeping it clean, efficient, and performant, that benefits you as well as your team.
